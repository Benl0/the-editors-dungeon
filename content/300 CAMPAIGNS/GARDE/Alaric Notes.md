# Backstory bullets
- Trained by his village
	- Good relationship with his family
	- Was given permission to become an adventurer
- Originally from or around Northern [[Liebe]]
	- Protects the small village of [[Liebe#Dorf|Dorf]] in the area
	- Helps to develop the village over multiple decades. Helping them protect themselves
- An Orc raiding party attacks the village, kidnapping the village elder's child.
	- After healing, Alaric goes after them, to the island of [[Leiden]]
	- After a hard fought journey and battle, he rescues the child
- On his way back, Alaric gets captured by wildmen

## Question:
1. Who is the village elder's child?
	1. Sorcerer?
2. Why did the orcs kidnap them?
	1. Sell them to [[The Crumbling Moon]]?
3. What if Alaric doesn't save the child?

## Route
Path that Alaric took:
1. Born somewhere in North [[Liebe]]
2. Moved towards the desert to a town bordering Liebe and [[Uld]]


# Relationships
- Ex-comrades
	- Where did they go?
	- Are they still alive?
	- How much time has passed from when he left for the [[Leiden]] to when he returned to the village?
- Villagers of Dorf
	- Why the change of attitude?
	- Do they believe he brough misfortune?
	- Do they think he abandoned them?


# How to use
- Dorf will be situated on the coast, somewhere between Kalt and the flooded woods. 
	- Must be on the coast for raiders from Leiden.
- The Party will head there before Leiden.
	- Perhaps Alaric never succeeded in rescuing the son
	- Leiden could be based on Thriller Bark and they use shadows to create powerful illusion magic
		- Alaric believes he saved everyone, way back when.
	- The comrades that survived are all imprisoned and getting older by the second
- The villagers remain cold and hostile to Alaric.
	- None of them can remember a time when Alaric was the patron protector of the village
		- They either weren't born or were too young.
	- It's only been stories, passed down.
- A handful of villagers know the truth.
	- They direct Alaric and the party to Leiden, asking them to save their people
	- To save time, They take a boat to Leiden.
		- Maybe a kraken or 2
- On Leiden, they will only find the elder's child. Now an elderly man
	- Everyone else passed, never losing hope that their mentor, protector and friend would come back for them.
