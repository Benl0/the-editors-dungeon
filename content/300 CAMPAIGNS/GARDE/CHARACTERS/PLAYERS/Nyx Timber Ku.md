# A Gnome Inventor
All gnome have three names, Nyx Timber Ku is the name but is well known as Ku.

Ku lives a fairly modest lifestyle, with a very frugal creed. Ku is know to forsake funds for equipment and research over basic needs like food. It is a common nature of all gnomes that grew up in black lane that resides in Haven. A representative  from  Taylor Docks will remind gnomes when its break time as one of their treasured patrons.

It is well-know that curiosity killed the cat and a section of the facility was destroyed with an experiment, This caused Nu's hair to resemble lit up gunpowder and gain a magic resistance.

Living a secluded life in the guild, Nu hasn't experienced true companionship. When speaking to other townspeople unknowingly rubs people the wrong way. Unable to truly emphasise with humans the most. 

For example, Ku unintentionally  broke a Kait traveller's treasured charm bracelet for the sake of an enhancing it on a whim. To this day the charm has not been fixed or replaced. Ku simply forgotten about it as all failed experiments do.

The guild master hopes Nu can better understand people as they will become possible future patrons in the future and believes this journey will help them gain more than a life of pure independence. Yet they still treasure Nu as a family member and as instructs a guardian in the form of crystal necklace, currently it is dormant refusing to start a contract.

## Personality Traits
There's nothing I like more than a good mystery
I am horribly awkward in social situations
## Ideals
No limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence.
## Bonds
I've been searching my whole life for an answer to a certain question
## Flaws
I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulating others. Also I tend to forget the plan, so you treat me like a wild card, joker you will get better results that way.
As a young gnome, I do not do well in high stress situations, creations need to be made with precise focus or else they will be in pieces with my absurd use of strength. Also my funds will be crying.
