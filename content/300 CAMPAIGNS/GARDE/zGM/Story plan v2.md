# Key

> [!INFO] Information the party will learn

> [!FAQ] Question to answer or ask

> [!TIP] Knowledge or fact to keep in mind

# Act 1
[Keep in mind](https://youtu.be/EdDE1fw0oYg?si=oUN8ZicAD8BSItOl)
- Inciting incident
	- What made the party go?
	- Did someone get hurt?
	- Natural disaster?
- Trials
	- What motivates the party to investigate? To uncover the truth? To stop the BBEG?
	- Personal?
	- Forced? 

> [!tip] The cultists don't perform petrification
> They sap the magical energy of the person to the point of death. 
> Why are they doing it? Are they trying to find Eliza and will petrify any powerful sorcerer?

> [!INFO] ASTRAL PLANE ANCHORS
> The petrified people are turned into anchors keeping Garde in one piece. Without the Anchors, Garde is weathered away by the elemental planes.

> [!FAQ] Does the banishment spell work?
> Because Garde is a giant Demiplane containing matter fully foreign to it itself, the banishment spell behaves strangely.
> The anchors also don't help, locking all physical matter from leaving. Only the soul can leave, since souls already travel the planes on the regular. A freed soul cannot be restrained

1. Rescue Eliza
	1. Earthquakes begin. 
	2. Tendrils from the elemental chaos and ethereal planes break through the earth
2. Go back to where Eliza was taken
	1. She was looking into the cult, 
	2. Researching where they took the other sorcerers
	3. Trying to learn what the petrification spell is
	4. They find another petrified human
	5. Holds a similar necklace or insignia to Dane's sister
3. Trying to rescue / touch the statue results in more earthquakes
	1. Root and branch like filaments of magic appear. Breaking out of the ground and descending from the sky
	2. Massive destruction ensues everywhere
	3. The magic sapped from the statues had nowhere to go, and now it is destructively forcing it's way back into Garde
	4. Dane's sister may have been taken by the cultists
4. 

## Questions to ask:
- What happened to Alaric's village? 
	- Why did they turn hostile?
	- Did he truly succeed in rescuing the prisoners?
	- Why did the Orc's attack?
- Where is Dane's sister?
	- Stolen by the cult for being a sorcerer?
	- Is she still alive?
**She is being hunted as a natural born sorcerer. She managed to escape but decided not to return home to keep the village safe.**

- Why was Pascal's warren attacked?
**Capitalism. The trees of the Warren are full of magical properties, perfect for surviving the magically charged sea water**

- Why was Sylvaris' royal family overthrown?
	- Why is Maximus helping?
- Who is Winslow's patron god?
	- Are they a helpful influence or something else?
- Who was the creature who created Garde?
	- if Warlock, who was the patron
	- Same patron as Winslow?
- Why has it taken Eliza so long to escape the Demiplane?
	- Who was in her party?
	- did she die in the original battle or was she forever altered?
- when should the party learn of the Demiplane?
	- Is Garde flat with water flowing off the edge
- If Banishment doesn't work, what happens instead?
	- Disadvantage?
	- Doesn't change plane but behaves like a short range teleport?
	- Fizzles into nothing?
	- **==Only banishes the soul and not the body==**
		- Otherwise works as normal but maybe the target stays conscious through the banishment.
		- They get to see the destruction of the forgotten realms


# Act 2

> [!INFO] Garde is a demiplane
> Eliza's party fought a Warlock or other creature that created a Demiplane door so large, it swallowed up a chunk of the continentthe continent
