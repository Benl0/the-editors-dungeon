##### Back: [[Garde GM MOC]] | Session: [[1.0 Just Another Job]]

# 1.0 Small Beginnings
> [!quote]+ Intro
> Haven is a relatively large town. It's nothing like the imposing Elven city of [[Aqiel]], nor as seedy as the Orc's [[Uld Town]], but it is home to many. Originally a Human settlement in the country of [[Verlust]], Haven got lucky. 
> The costal location was perfect for trade. Haven's sailors and merchants were - and still are - know for being cutthroat, direct and crazy enough to sail through Reve's Crossing more than once in a lifetime.
> *Introduce players*
