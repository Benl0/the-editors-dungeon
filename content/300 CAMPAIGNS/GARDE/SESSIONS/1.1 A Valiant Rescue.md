# Cultist Cave
- A strange [[Myla Damakos|Tiefling wizard]] was presiding over an evil occult ritual. [[Eliza Trotz|Eliza]] is trapped against a stone plinth at the back of the cave.
	- A wand, charged with strange spell, is painfully turning Eliza to stone. A cultist is using the wand.
- The Tiefling wizard and the cultist talked about Eliza's uncommon strength, just before the party is spotted. 

> [!QUOTE] Tiefling Wizard
> *Take care of them...*

- The wizard teleports away, leaving the 5 cultists to take fight the party.

## The fight begins
*The first blows*
- [[Alaric]] hides in the shadows and fires a perfect arrow at the wand, knocking it out of the cultist's hand.
	- The spell is stopped almost immediately.
	- [[Eliza Trotz|Eliza]] still screams in pain, However. The existing petrification not fading away.
- [[Winslow]] burns a hole in one of the cultist's very nice red robes.
- [[Maximus Ironshield|Maximus]] steels his thoughts and readies his sword for any who dare approach.
	- They didn't stand a chance.
- [[Nyx Timber Ku|Ku]] restricts the cultists options with some clever magical tinkering.
- [[Pascal]] and [[Dane Sparkfire|Dane]] turn a corner and attack the cultists from behind.
- [[Sylvaris Nightwhisper|Sylvaris]] charges past the ruckus to back up Alaric in his fight.

*Even though the wand's spell was stopped in it's tracks, the very earth trembles. In the same instant, roots made of pure magical energy burst from the ground.*

- Ku touches the root, using the [[Identify]] spell to try and understand what they might be.
	- She unexpectedly gains the temporary ability to teleport short distances.

*Just as the party is gaining the upper hand, backup arrives from the cave entrance.*

- Dane is attacked from behind.
	- Maximus and Winslow back him up right away.
- Pascal and Ku run to the back of the cave, attempting to intimidate the cultist's defacto leader.
	- Sylvaris exploits the cultist's weakness. Rodents!
	- [[Scabbers]] is all over him and the remaining cult members flee with their lives.

## Victory in the face of danger

*The party interrogates the remaining cultist while they undo the restraints on Eliza. She unconscious but otherwise unharmed*

> [!QUOTE] Cultist (under extreme rodent duress)
> *Please. PLEASE! You must let us continue. We have to do this. We must! Garde must be saved! The crumbling moon is fading away!*

*Amongst the idle chatter, the cultist is able to steel his nerves, one last time.*

- He fires one last spell, burning and destroying the wand. Then immediately bites down on his teeth.
	- His body is engulfed in arcane fire, killing him.

> [!QUOTE] Cultist final words
> *Life for the people. Blood for The Crumbling Moon.*


*Searching his body, the party learns the name of the cult.*

- [[The Crumbling Moon]]

## Exiting the cave

*Exploring the remainder of the cave, the party finds the following items.* 

- [[Gravity Stone]]
- [[Robe of Bread]]
- Multiple [[Broken Wand|Broken Wands]] of the same type used on Eliza.

*Having stabilised Eliza, and the petrification starting to fade, the party prepares to journey back to [[Haven]]. As soon as they reach the exit, a giant, glimmering dragon swoops down. The taste of dust and danger in everyone's mouth.*
*The dragon slowly scans the party before finally resting its gaze on Eliza*
