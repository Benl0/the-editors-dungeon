# [[The Spear Inn]]
- The party arrive at the inn one by one. Each of them found a job advert saying to "meet at the Spear Inn in the far corner"
- [[Pascal]] gets in trouble by spilling a bandit's toilet ale and an altercation begins.
- The party absolutely destroys the bandit and his friends.
	- [[Maximus Ironshield|Maximus]] even splits the bandit called [[Bandit Jeremy|Jeremy]] in two.
- [[Jeremy Hartfall]] interjects and stops the fight. Hopefully also avoiding trouble from the law.
- The party is given the mission to find, and maybe save, [[Eliza Trotz]], someone important to [[Jeremy Hartfall]]

# Cultist Cave
- After searching for a day and a half, the party spots someone spying on them.
- Giving chase, they find a cave with cultists and zombies. Rotting corpses and skeletons cover the rocky walls along with their dried blood.
- [[Nyx Timber Ku|Ku]] in their first real fight was close to death, but was saved by [[Alaric|Alaric's]] sharp shooting and [[Winslow|Winslow's]] eldritch energies.
- [[Winslow]] became a loose canon, even compared to [[Scabbers]], as all the his final shots became fatal.
- Fighting through to the end of the of the cave, the party finds ruins of a long forgotten temple.
	- At the back, pinned above a crumbled statue is a woman who could only be [[Eliza Trotz]].
	- The cultists around her are performing some sort of ritual. Whatever it is, it's not good news.
