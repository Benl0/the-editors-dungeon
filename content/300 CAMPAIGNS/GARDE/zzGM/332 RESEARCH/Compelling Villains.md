# Three Pillars by Connie Chang
## 1. [Tangible Goals]([https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeyc9Mx3/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeyc9Mx3/))
- Strong verb with a greater context
	- **Kill** the prince
	- **Steal** the gem
	- **Escape** the prison
- Something clear and actionable that is either win or lose
- Strong verbs should serve as steps to the bigger and overarching goal
	- **Control** the world
	- **Save** my friends
- Broad and can take multiple steps
- Doesn't have to be nefarious 
- The eggs aren't in one basket. The party can and should thwart one or more plans
	- The plan can and should change. Nothing ever goes to plan
## 2. [Dangerous Methods]([https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeyc2rKs/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeyc2rKs/))
- How the villain achieves their goals
- **Strength**
	- Resources
		- Money
		- Supporters and fighters (henchmen)
		- Powerful artifacts
	- Abilities
		- Special or rare powers (e.g. mind control)
		- Can be character based such as being incredibly charismatic or strong
		- What they can do that makes them unique
	- Moves
		- Doing stuff because they are the villain
		- Similar to legendary actions with a narrative focus
		- Should be used outside of combat, can can serve both
- **Tactics**
	- The strategies used to achieve their goals, depending on their personality and core values
		- A vengeful villain may salt the earth in their path of destruction
		- A subtle villain may initiate a vote of no confidence to take control of the senate (Palpatine)
	- There will be multiple ways to achieve their goals
	- Here is where the villain leverages their strengths to either get the job done themselves, or pay/trick others into doing it for them
## 3. [Ironclad Reasons]([https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeycSSbh/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeycSSbh/))
- What drives the villain's quest? Why do they do what they do? What to they desire?
- Good motivation is: "Clear, specific, flexible and generative"
- **Clarity**
	- The party should understand why the villain is doing this, but not necessarily agree.
-  **Specificity**
	- The villain's motives are their own. Their backstory has informed and shaped who they are today
	- The inciting incidents that pushed them to the brink. When did they snap?
- **Flexibility**
	- The players can and will strike the villain close to home, reaching their motives either emotionally or logically.
	- The villain's mind can and should change. They are not an unthinking creature and can grow
	- The final goal doesn't have to change, but their strategies and motives can
- **Generative potential**
	- A method to create interesting story and decisions.
	- Has the party been placed in a difficult decision? Will saving one person mean the city falls?
	- Has the villain succeeded and now the party must claw back what they lost?
### 3b. A character's need
- What does the villain lack?
- What hole do they have in their heart?
- Are they even aware of this?
