# Backstory
Princess Eliza Trotz is a beloved public figure in Haven. As the second youngest royal child, she doesn't receive the majority of pressure and expecations


==Princess Eliza Trotz is far more than the beloved royal figure she appears to be. She is, in fact, an ancient sorceress who has extended her life through powerful, forbidden magic. Once a great and feared archmage in a bygone era, she was able to hide her essence within the bloodline of the Volara family, re-emerging in each generation to preserve her consciousness and power.

==In her current incarnation, Eliza has maintained her noble facade while secretly advancing her own agenda to control the escalating magic of Garde. Her ultimate goal is to harness this runaway magic to ascend to a god-like status, reshaping the world to her will. To this end, she has allied with Sir Jeremy Hartfall, manipulating him to believe in a shared vision for a stronger, united Garde, all while preparing to betray him when the time is right.

## Role in the Campaign

Eliza presents herself as a benevolent and wise princess, offering aid and counsel to the party. Her charm and apparent dedication to the kingdom's welfare make her an invaluable ally. However, she is orchestrating a grand scheme to absorb the chaos of Garde’s magic, seeking to become the ultimate planar anchor herself.

### Hooks
- **The Royal Ally:** Eliza assigns the party missions that appear to protect the kingdom but actually advance her own plans, such as retrieving ancient artifacts or securing powerful sorcerers.
- **The Hidden Threat:** The party may uncover hints of her true nature through cryptic visions, ancient texts, or the testimonies of other sorcerers.
- **The Betrayal:** At a pivotal moment, Eliza reveals her true identity and intentions, attempting to use the party as pawns in her final ritual to absorb Garde’s runaway magic.

### Quotes
- “The well-being of Garde rests on strong shoulders and clear minds. Together, we shall navigate these turbulent times.”
- “In a world of crumbling order, only those with the vision to rebuild shall rise above the ruins.”
- “You are but pieces in a greater game, and the time has come for the board to be reset.”
