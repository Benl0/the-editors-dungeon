##### Back: [[Garde]]
# Dethroned Royalty
A [[Elf|High-Elf]] from [[Aqiel]]. Originally part of the royal family, Sylvaris was caught up in a coup. They had to survive on the streets and have thus learned the ways of the underworld. Her only companion was a pet mouse named [[Scabbers]].
Eventually, Sylvaris was saved by [[Maximus Ironshield]] and for the past year - perhaps somewhat begrudgingly - they have been inseparable.

I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took pity on me

I'd rather kill someone in their sleep then fight fair.
