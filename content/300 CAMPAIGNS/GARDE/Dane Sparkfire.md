##### Back: [[Garde]]
# At any cost, I'll get her back

As a young boy Dane was a happy farmers son living with his mother and older sister, [[Arla]]. His father was never in a picture and his mother kept information about him short and vague. He did however have a strong bond with his older sister who had huge magical potential even at an early age.

In Dane’s 7th year, the Sparkfire home was attacked by a group of warlocks who killed his mother and abducted his older sister and close family friend, an Elf name [[Niri]]. Both Arla and Niri haven’t been seen since. Now, Dane’s personal quest is one of revenge and rescue. Finding and killing those who murdered his mother and rescuing his sister and Niri. His adolescent years were filled with pain, anger, fear and desperation.

Without a home and the loss of his family Dane resorted to thievery to survive. Often getting into fights. This was until he encountered [[Krim]], a sell sword who Dane actually tried to steal from. Perhaps seeing something within Dane, Krim decided to take him under his wing and after learning of his origins, trained Dane in the ways of the sword. Providing him with martial arts and weapon skills. Krim did more than this however, becoming a father figure to Dane. Teaching him how to control his emotions especially during a fight and helping him find leads on the warlocks’ whereabouts. Providing a roadmap of sorts so Dane would have a good chance in facing off against magic users.

Roughly a decade of training has not just turned Dane into a capable fighter but a well travelled and experienced person with additional connections and allies of his own. Dane’s goal as a sell sword is to build up enough experience in fighting, gain strong allies and use his sell sword earnings to find magical neutralising objects that can give him and edge in the one fight that matters.
