# **The Crumbling Moon: A Manifesto**

## **Prologue: The Descent into Chaos**

A dark truth lies beneath our very feet: the land is fracturing, disintegrating into chaos. Magic, the lifeblood of our world, is seeping through the cracks, accelerating the disintegration. If unchecked, Garde will dissolve into the elemental chaos of the planes. We are **The Crumbling Moon**, custodians of this grim knowledge.

---

## **Chapter I: The Unveiling of Fate**

### **1.1 The Fractured Truth**

From the highest peaks of the ==Frostspire== to the deepest caverns of the ==Emberlands==, the signs are evident: Garde is breaking apart. Magic is spilling from its core, leaving the people, and accelerating the planet’s demise. Without intervention, our world will disintegrate into the ethereal planes, losing all form and reason.

### **1.2 The Mandate of The Crumbling Moon**

We, The Crumbling Moon, have been chosen since **The Day of Realisation**. We stand on the brink of annihilation, tasked with a singular purpose: to capture and release the power of sorcerers into Planar Anchors that will stabilise our world. Through their magic, we will mend the fractures and stave off the chaos.

## **Chapter II: The Doctrine of Binding**

### **2.1 The Nature of Sorcery**

Sorcerers are not merely wielders of magic; they are living conduits to the arcane energies coursing through Garde. Their inherent power siphons from all of us, taking away what binds land. To save Garde, we must harness their essence, returning the arcane energy to Garde via the Planar Anchors.

### **2.2 The Creation of Planar Anchors**

To anchor Garde against the elemental planes, sorcerers must undergo the Rite of Binding. This ritual forges their magic into an anchor, stabilizing the fabric of our reality. Each sorcerer thus bound strengthens our hold on the crumbling world, creating a lattice that contains the rampant magic and prevents further loss.

## **Chapter III: The Structure of Guardianship**

### **3.1 The Luminous Council**

At the heart of The Crumbling Moon stands the Luminous Council, the overseers who interpret the arcane signs and direct our sacred mission. Each member is a master of magic and binding, their wisdom and power guiding our efforts to stabilize Garde.

### **3.2 The Harvesters**

The Harvesters are the dedicated agents who seek out sorcerers across Garde. They journey through cities, villages, and wild lands, identifying and capturing those with potent arcane abilities. They bear the duty of conducting the Rite of Binding, turning raw power into the salvation of our world.

### **3.3 The Defenders**

Dedicated to the protection of our order, the Defenders are non-magic users. They protect the Anchors, before, during and after the Rite of Binding, on occasion also assisting the Harvesters to apprehend sorcerers.  

### **3.4 The Anchors**

The Anchors are the sorcerers who have been bound, their magic now a part of the planar stabilization network. Their sacrifice will always be remembered.

---

## **Chapter IV: The Path of Preservation**

### **4.1 The Gathering**

We must continually gather sorcerers from all corners of Garde. Whether from the esteemed halls of the Arcane Academies or the remote enclaves of wild mages, all must be brought into the fold. The Gathering is a relentless pursuit, a race against the encroaching chaos.

### **4.2 The Celestial Fortress**

==Deep within the epicenter of Garde’s magical heart lies the Celestial Fortress, our stronghold. Here, the Luminous Council orchestrates the creation of Planar Anchors and the maintenance of our network. It is our sanctuary, our place of binding, and our bulwark against the impending dissolution.==

### **4.3 The Vigilance**

==The Vigilance is our unyielding watch over the state of Garde. We monitor the fractures, predict the surges of magic, and deploy our forces to intercept and contain the breaches. Each crisis is a test, each successful binding a victory against the abyss.==

## **Chapter V: The Vision Beyond Chaos**

### **5.1 A Stabilized World**

We envision a Garde where the rampant magic is contained, where the balance between the elemental planes and our reality is restored. This is the future we strive for: a world where sorcery is the key to survival, not a harbinger of doom.

### **5.2 The Eternal Vigil**

Even as we stabilize Garde, our vigilance must never waver. We will remain guardians of the world’s balance, ever watchful for new threats, ever prepared to renew the bindings. The Crumbling Moon will evolve into the Eternal Moon, perpetual guardians against the chaos beyond.

---

## **Epilogue: The Pledge**

By the light of the fading world, by the shards of our crumbling reality, we pledge our lives, our power, and our eternal vigilance. We are **The Crumbling Moon**, and we shall not rest until all are saved.

---

**Join us, sorcerers of Garde, and let us bind the realms, for in your essence lies the salvation of our world.**
