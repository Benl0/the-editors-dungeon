#### **Backstory**

Sir Jeremy Hartfall was born into a noble family in Haven, destined for honor and chivalry. Trained as a paladin from a young age, he rose through the ranks of the royal guard, earning the trust of the city and its rulers. His dedication to the crown and his exemplary service earned him the position of the leader of the royal guards, where he oversaw the protection of the city and its royal family, including Princess Eliza.

However, the burden of duty and the corruption within the royal court slowly disillusioned Jeremy. Witnessing the inefficacies and weaknesses of those in power, he became disillusioned with his oath and saw the potential for a new order, one that he could shape alongside Eliza. Turning to dark forces, he broke his sacred vows and became an Oathbreaker, forming a secret alliance with the princess.

Together, they plan to seize control of Haven and implement their vision of a stronger, more ruthless rule. Jeremy's charm and noble facade hide his true allegiance, and he uses his position to manipulate and deceive those around him, including the party, until the moment comes for their betrayal.

#### **Role in the Campaign**

Jeremy serves as a helpful and charismatic ally to the party initially, providing assistance, resources, and advice. His role as the leader of the royal guards allows him to offer access to areas of the city that would otherwise be off-limits and to provide crucial information about threats to Haven. However, his true motives remain hidden as he uses the party to further his and Eliza’s plans.

**Hooks:**
- **Aiding the Party:** Jeremy tasks the party with missions that align with the city's defense but subtly advance his own agenda, such as rooting out threats that oppose him.
- **The Betrayal:** At a critical moment, Jeremy and Eliza turn against the party, revealing their plan to overthrow the current rule of Haven. This betrayal could come during a significant battle or political upheaval, with Jeremy revealing his Oathbreaker nature.
- **Confrontation:** The party must face Jeremy in combat or negotiate with him as he attempts to convince them to join his cause or succumb to his ambitions.

**Quotes:**
- “In these troubled times, one must choose their allies wisely. I trust we will be on the same side.”
- “A strong hand and a clear vision are what this city needs, not the indecision of a faltering court.”
- “Loyalty, like the light, can be cast in many shades. Sometimes, to protect, one must break what binds them.”
