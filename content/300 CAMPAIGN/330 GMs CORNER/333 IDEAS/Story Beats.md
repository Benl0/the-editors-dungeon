# Campaign 1 Story Beats
[[Campaign Ideas|Reference]]

## Background
### Eons ago
1. A giant battle between good and evil
2. One attack was so massive it pushed an immense chunk of the world into a new, separate plane, permanently scarring both
3. The loser was pushed into the new plane and dissolved. Their magical essence dispersing throughout and into the water
	1. The water becomes magically charged and incredibly volatile
	2. Touching it has the same effect as ==wild magic (??)== and falling in can be fatal
	3. The magic is mostly contained to the sea water. Fresh water has only minor traces, making it (mostly) safe to drink
4. At the edges of the world, sea water falls down from the heavens, like water dropping off the edge of a flat earth into Garde
### 3-400 years ago
1. Pregnant Queen falls into water. Survives
2. Twins (prince & princess) born with incredible magic potential having absorbed the magic from the water
	1. Magic water calms down as more and more magic moves to the twins
	2. The big bad was absorbed into the twins, splitting it's magical energy
3. Twins become comfortable with their magic, try to return to the Material plane
4. Fight ensues, prince is killed
	1. The magic is released back into the water
	2. The remaining magic on the body is captured into several magical items
	3. With only half the magic, Princess cannot return to the Material plane
5. Princess returns to Royal castle and begins to wipe memories
	1. ==A few escape and form a group (cult?)== tasked with destroying the princess
6. This time is either forgotten or falls into legend as the Princess bides her time
	1. Something like the One Piece 100 year gap occurs in history
7. Prince's body is locked away behind magic seals and barriers, preventing the Princess from retrieving him

## Present day
### Act 1
1. Princess lets herself get kidnapped by the cult
2.  Adventurers are hired, seemingly at random to rescue her
	1. Person who hires them could be a Paladin who knows the truth
3. The Princess tells the heros that the magic water is becoming more unstable and risks destroying everything
	1. Only 1 ==macguffin== can prevent this catastrophe (the Prince's body)
### Act 2
1. The Princess Dimension doors the heros to each location, in the four corners of the world
	1. Each item is heavily guarded and is integral to the local population's lives and culture
2. As each item is recovered, the world keeps growing unstable
	1. The magic items are growing more active as they get closer together
	2. Increases the urgency
	3. At each location, the cult is there, trying to stop them
3. Once the macguffin is assembled, the Princess rushes to the water, absorbing the Prince's magic into it
	1. He appears and the truth is revealed
### Act 3
1. Princess and Prince rush to the centre of the world to the escape portal
	1. The escape portal is what remains of the big bad's original body ==(crystal skull?)==
	2. If they escape, Garde would be destroyed
2. Epic fight occurs to stop them
	1. The princess continues to insult the heros, saying they and the world aren't real
3. When the heros have the upper hand, the Princess absorbs the Prince, killing him but finally bringing the magic into one body
4. ==When the heros defeat the Princess the magic returns to the water (??)==
	1. ==They discover she was trying to save her home (Gurren Lagann anti-spiral twist??)==
	2. ==2nd campaign is to save the Material plane (??)==
