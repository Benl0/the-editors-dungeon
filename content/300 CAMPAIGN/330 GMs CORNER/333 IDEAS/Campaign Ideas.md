# Ideas
- Rescue king from dragon 
- Princess less the charge on finding and hiring the adventurers 
- Maybe Princess tried to do it herself but failed. Learned a valuable lesson about asking for help (She-Ra’s Glimmer)  
	- Princess finds and joins the party. 
	- She can be a trained healer? 
	- Eventually she falls ill, is badly hurt in a battle or must return home to care for the kingdom 
	- Evil royal assistant takes over and runs the kingdom into ruin? 
- THEME PARK IN GOB LAND

# Story
- 2 gods at war
	- Long ago, an adventurer used a weapon to silence the fight
	- The blast permanently scarred the land. 
	- Water rushed into the scar and became a meeting point of the god’s opposite magical energy
	- Touching the water results in extreme harm for mortals and gods alike
	- The disembodied energy of the gods still fights in these waters as it sparkles away
	- All this has fallen to legend
- Potential gods:
	- Ilmater, god of Endurance & Loviatar, goddess of pain
- Garde has been shifted into an alternate material plane
# Memes
- An NPC is on a quest to find their son. Join the party but find out they died because of something the NPC did/had them do. Some time later, while reflecting on the son’s birthday… *play ‘Leaves from the vine’*
- Mr blobby 
- Diggy Diggy Hole dwarven band 

# Music
- Plenty of pre-made playlists on spotify 
- Also, video games and other media sound tracks 
	- Avatar: The Last Airbender
	- Lord Of The Rings
	- Elder Scrolls 
		- Oblivion 
		- Skyrim 
	- Hades (?) 
	- Westworld (more for inspiration)
	- Game Of Thrones 
	- Bauldurs Gate 

Really getting the sense to plan and script around pieces of music. Really editorialise it
