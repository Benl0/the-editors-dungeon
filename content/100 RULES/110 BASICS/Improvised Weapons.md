# In a Pinch
Lost your weapon? Then it's time to get creative! If you can reasonably hold an object in one or two hands, you can use it as an improvised weapon.

## Damage
Ultimately it is at the GM's discretion, but the standard is $1d4$ with whatever [[Damage Type|damage type]] is most appropriate.

| Attack | Damage                     |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| Melee  | $1d4$                      |
| Ranged | $\text{1d4 (range 20/60)}$ |
