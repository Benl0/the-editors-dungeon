# Selling
On your adventure you will collect rare items and goods to sell.

## Weapons and Armour
If in good condition, you can sell for half the market value. Most won't be.
## Magic Items
Difficult to sell due to the high price they fetch. Most go beyond gold.
## Gems and Fine Art
Retains their full value and can be used as a currency of its own.
## Trade Goods
Out into the wilds, gold pieces mean little. Bartering with your resources is the way to go.
