# Skill from Ability
[[Abilities#Skills|Skill]] modifiers are first derived from their governing [[Abilities#Abilities|ability]]. That is to say, if a character has +3 to *Strength*, they also receive +3 to *Athletics*. The same goes for negative modifiers.
# Proficiency
Then finally it's [[Proficiency Bonus]].

For example, you may be a Elf Paladin who grew up in a city slum, stealing and scraping by. Because of that past, this character could have proficiency in *Deception* or *Thieves Tools* that may not other wise be granted.
