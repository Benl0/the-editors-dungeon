# Hit Dice

^071c4e

Each character receives one Hit Dice per level starting at 1. The type of dice is determined by the character's class.
Hit Dice are used during a [[Short Rest]] to recover HP. Roll the relevant die and add the Constitution modifier. That is how many Hit Points have been recovered.
Hit Dice can only be replenished after a [[Long Rest]] with a maximum of half your total hit die.
## Types of Hit Dice
d6, d8, d10, d12
