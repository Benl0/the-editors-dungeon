# Try not to get Hurt
How well can you dodge? When characters take damage, they're not really brushing a stab wound. They duck and weave and occasionally they might slip and get a bit too close to the business end of an axe. It's then that they would lose [[Hit Points]], from exhaustion and exertion, rather than cuts and bruises.
Armour Class is your ability to dodge and avoid those attacks. Formula below:
$$10+Dex$$
If you are wearing [[Armour]] or using a shield, the base stat will be different.
