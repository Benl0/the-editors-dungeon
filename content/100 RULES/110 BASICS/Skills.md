# Skills of Life 

> [!missing] This page is incomplete

Skills are subclasses of the main 6 [[Abilities]] and go into more specificity. With the exception of constitution, each ability has associated skills. For example, if you're attempting to sneak past an enemy, you would roll *Dexterity*, but *Stealth* instead. Skills take the dice modifier from the related ability, but they can be different depending on [[Proficiency Bonus]] and more.
