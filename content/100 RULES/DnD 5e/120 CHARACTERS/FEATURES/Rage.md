In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy [[Armour]]:
- You have advantage on Strength [[Ability Checks|checks]] and Strength [[Saving Throw|saving throws]].
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a [[Barbarian]], as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to [[Damage Type#Bludgeoning|bludgeoning]], [[Damage Type#Piercing|piercing]], and [[Damage Type#Slashing|slashing]] damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. 
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table. you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
