A saving throw can be requested from you at any point, but typically it will be to avoid a spell or some other attack. The type of saving throw determines the [[Ability Modifiers|Ability Modifier]] used.
Each save will have a success threshold known as a **DC** or *Difficulty Class*. You must reach that number to save. A DC can be anything from 1 to 30, with 1 being child's-play and 30 being practically impossible.
