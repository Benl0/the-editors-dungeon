# A Numbers Game
[[Abilities#Abilities|Ability scores]] are the big windows on the left hand side of your character sheet. These are:
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

## Rolling Dice
1. Roll `4 d6`
2. Add up the highest `3` values and note down
3. Repeat for a total of `6` times, one for each ability

Example dice rolls:

| Dice 1 | Dice 2 | Dice 3 | Dice 4 | Result |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| *1*    | *1*    | *3*    | *6*    | **10** |
| *2*    | *3*    | *4*    | *4*    | **11** |
| *1*    | *1*    | *4*    | *5*    | **10** |
| *2*    | *3*    | *4*    | *3*    | **10** |
| *2*    | *5*    | *6*    | *6*    | **17** |
| *1*    | *1*    | *5*    | *6*    | **12** |

From here, you can either: 
1. Assign scores at random
2. Choose where they go

> [!TIP]+ Rolling the dice
> While having randomly assigned ability scores might be interesting, it may also go against your plans for your character. When in doubt, choose your abilities
## Pre-Determined
Alternatively, if the randomness of dice rolling not appealing, the following numbers can be used as ability scores wherever you like:
- `15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8`
## Point Allocations
Starting with `8` on every ability, spend points to increase ability scores. You have `27` points at your disposal. Lower scores only require `1` point, but after `13`, each ability requires `2` points up to a max of `15`. 

| Total Point Cost | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 7   | 9   |
| ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ability score    | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |

## Character traits
Depending on your chosen [[Races|race]] and [[Classes|class]], you will have a bonus (or a detriment) to one or more abilities. Make sure to pay attention to the traits sections!
# Ability Modifiers
Once all the scores are counted, itâ€™s time to count figure out the Ability Modifiers. This is the little plus or minus that gets added to dice rolls.
Either use the table below or use the following formula where $x$ is the Ability score:
$$
\frac{x-10}{2}=y
$$


| **Score** | Modifier | **Score** | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| **1**     | -5       | **16-17** | +3       |
| **2-3**   | -4       | **18-19** | +4       |
| **4-5**   | -3       | **20-21** | +5       |
| **6-7**   | -2       | **22-23** | +6       |
| **8-9**   | -1       | **24-25** | +7       |
| **10-11** | +0       | **26-27** | +8       |
| **12-13** | +1       | **28-29** | +9       |
| **14-15** | +2       | **30**    | +10      |
