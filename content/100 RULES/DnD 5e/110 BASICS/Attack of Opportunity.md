# Eyes on your Enemy
In the heat of a battle, you must stay focused on your opponent. If your enemy moves out of your attack reach (e.g. 5ft for a melee attack), you get a [[Actions#Reactions|reaction]] attack. If you hit, you stop all their movement. However, the same works in reverse!

An attack of opportunity won't be triggered if the creature either:
1. Takes the [[Actions#^e77e55|disengage]] action
2. [[Teleport|Teleports]]
3. An external force causes the movement
