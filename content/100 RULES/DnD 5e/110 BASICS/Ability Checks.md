# Test your Mettle
> [!BUG] This page is incomplete 

This is where you character's [[Abilities]] and [[Skills]] are used. Where the harsh [[Garde World|World]] tests them until they succeed, or fail...

An Ability Check can happen at any point using the most relevant Ability or Skill. Ultimately, that decision is up to the GM's discretion. 
Common situations for an Ability Check include:
- Performing an action, both in and out of [[Combat Order]]
- Resisting an attack
- Charming the waiter for free drinks
- Stealing drinks under the waiter's nose
- Backflip
You will roll a [[Dice|d20]] and the number required will be represented by a Difficulty Class (**DC**). After adding any bonuses and [[Proficiency Bonus|Proficiency]], if you reach the number, you succeed. 

| Task Difficulty   | DC  |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Very easy         | 5   |
| Easy              | 10  |
| Medium            | 15  |
| Hard              | 20  |
| Very hard         | 25  |
| Nearly impossible | 30  |

# Alternative Checks
There are certain situations that require different types of Ability Checks. See below for more.
## Contests
When two characters or creatures are trying to do the same thing, or are actively trying to prevent another's actions, a contest is initiated. This can be:
- Closing/Opening a door
- Snatch a magic ring from the floor
- Clashing swords
Both participants must make a normal d20 Ability Check, but must compare against each other. Whoever has the highest total, succeeds.
