# Taking a Dagger to a Spells Fight

## Step by Step
1. Determine surprise
	- Dependent on a successful stealth attempt. If your [[Skills#Stealth|Stealth]] beats the enemies [[Skills#Passive Perception|Passive Perception]], you succeed. 
	- A surprised creature cannot act in the first turn of combat, despite it's initiative roll.
2. Roll [[Initiative]]
	- Roll a d20 plus your [[Abilities#Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier
	- This number determines everyone's order
3. Your turn
	1. Choose an [[Actions|action]]
	2. Use your movement
4. Begin the next round
