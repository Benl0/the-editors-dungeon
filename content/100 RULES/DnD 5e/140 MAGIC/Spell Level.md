[Spells](https://benl0.github.io/The-Editors-Dungeon/tags/DnD/Spells) are a singular expression of the world's energies, and their power is determined by the Spell level. To use a specific spell, you must expend a spell slot at the same level or higher. No spell slot, no spell. The only exceptions are Cantrips which can be used without spell slots.
