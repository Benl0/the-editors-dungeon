# Let me just read my notes

Some [[Classes]], like [[Wizard]] have a truly tremendous quantity of spells available to them. However, you cannot hide in corner of every combat encounter, shuffle through your [[Spellbook]] and read out the spell. To cast a powerful spell, you must prepare for it! 

> [!TIP] Cantrips
> You only need to prepare levelled spells. [Cantrips](https://benl0.github.io/The-Editors-Dungeon/tags/DnD/Spells/Cantrip) are always available to you. 

> [!important] Spells Known
> Some classes like [[Bard]] and [[Warlock]] have a "Spells Known" column. They do not need to prepare spells, but they have a more limited selection, i.e. the spells they know.

You may have all the magic in existence at your fingertips, but you can only use 1 on any given day. Your class will specify how many prepared spells you have. See below for a quick reference table.

| Class         | Spellcasting Ability | Formula                   |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [[Bard]]      | Charisma             | *Spells known*            |
| [[Cleric]]    | Wisdom               | $Wis. mod + Level$        |
| [[Druid]]     | Wisdom               | $Wis. mod + Level$        |
| [[Paladin]]   | Charisma             | $Cha. mod + (Level\div2)$ |
| [[Ranger]]    | Wisdom               | *Spells known*            |
| [[Sorcerer]]  | Charisma             | *Spells known*            |
| [[Warlock]]   | Charisma             | *Spells known*            |
| [[Wizard]]    | Intelligence         | $Int. mod + Level$        |
| [[Artificer]] | Intelligence         | $Int. mod + (Level\div2)$ |
