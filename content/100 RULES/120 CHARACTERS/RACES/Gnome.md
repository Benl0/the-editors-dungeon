### Tinker
You have proficiency with [[Tinker's tools]]. Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning). or when you use your action to dismantle it: at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:
- **Clockwork Toy.** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog. mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
- **Fire Starter.** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch. or campfire. Using the device requires your action.
- **Music Box.** When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
