# Incredible talents
A feat is a skill or ability that your character has high level of expertise in, beyond what might be considered standard training for your [[Classes|class]].
On level up, you occasionally gain an [[Abilities|ability score]] improvement [[Features|feature]]. You can optionally choose to gain a feat instead, provided you meet the minimum requirements.

> [!Warning] Losing a prerequisite
>If you lose the minimum requirements for a feat for any reason, you lose the benefits of the feat. If you recover, the benefits return
