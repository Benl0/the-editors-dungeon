# Personality
A background is a way to give characters history. Who were they before the adventure and what hardship have they already endured? There are a wide selection of pre-made backgrounds, however this can be created entirely from scratch by both player and GM.
## Traits
Two small descriptors that set your character apart. Think beyond "I'm smart" and more towards "I've read every book in my father's library twice". If you're at a loss, try looking to your [[Abilities|ability scores]]. With high Dexterity did you grow up in a travelling circus?
## Ideals
One thing that drives your character. What is the moral dilemma that will compel you to act, no matter what?
## Bonds
One connection to a person, place or event in the world. Do you have family back home? Are you a survivor of a vicious bandit raid? Who or what will drive you against our own self interests if they are threatened?
## Flaws
One weakness or fear that somebody could potentially exploit. What are you afraid of? What sends you in a blind rage? Do you have a vice?
