# Wear this, Don't die
In D&D 5e, armour lets you increase your [[Armour Class|AC]] by providing a higher base stat than 10.
## Armour Proficiency
- Wearing armour you don't have proficiency in results in disadvantage in:
	- Ability checks
	- Saving throws
	- Attack rolls involving Strength or Dexterity
	- Can't cast spells
## Shields
- Only one shield may be equipped at one time
- Using a shield increase AC by 2
# Armour Types
- [[Light Armour]]: retaining mobility while offering some protection.
- [[Medium Armour]]: a balance, offering a little more protection.
- [[Heavy Armour]]: full protection, requiring immense strength to wear.
