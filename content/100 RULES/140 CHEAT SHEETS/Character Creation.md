*Step by step on character creation*
# 1. [Race](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races)
Think Humans and Elves, Dwarves and Halflings. Choosing a race can be as simple as what you think is cool, but there can be an element of gameplay. Each race has specific attributes, skills, advantages and disadvantages that will come in handy through the adventure. 
For example, as a High Elf, you start the game with an extra [[Cantrip]] (magic spell), setting you up perfectly for a magic build. However, don't feel restricted to what makes sense.

**Sub-race**
Some races have 2 or more sub-races that change or add abilities. High Elf is one such sub-race, alongside Wood Elf and Dark Elf. Not every race has sub-races so be sure to pay attention at the bottom of the info sheet.

**Traits and Skills**
As mentioned above, each race has a specific set of skills. Every character is unique but these traits will have an effect on how you play to what languages you speak! Continuing with the High Elf example, see its traits below:
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

> [!example]+ High Elf Traits
> - Ability scores: +2 Dex, +1 Int
> - Size: Medium
> - Speed: 30
> - Abilities:
> 	- Darkvision
> 	- Keen Senses
> 	- Fey Ancestry
> 	- Trance
> 	- Elf Weapon Training
> 	- Cantrip of your choice
> - Languages:
> 	- Common
> 	- Elvish
> 	- +1

> [!TIP] Once chosen, note down:
> - Size
> - Speed
> - Ability score changes (more on this later)
> - Languages spoken
> - Special abilities and proficiencies

> [!FAQ] Proficiency
> Proficiency is a certain skill that you are particularly good at because of your race, background or class. Starting at level 1, this means a +2 to your dice rolls. Proficiency is marked by the little circles next to the saving throws and skills section

> [!Warning] To keep things simple, please only select from the Player’s Handbook / Basic rules section.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 2. [Class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes)
Class determines the profession and associated skills and abilities of a character. Think magic as a wizard and swords as a fighter. Some races’ traits go hand in hand with certain classes, all determining how the character is played.

**Playstyle**
A [[Rogue]] moves through the shadows to reach their target, while a [[Bard]] woos the bartender to find the secrets of the town. If you have an idea of how you would like to play, see if you can find something that fits that as much as possible.

**Hit Points & Hit Dice**
HP is your life points. Once it reaches zero, you're out (sort of). Each class starts off with a base amount, plus your constitution modifier (more on that later). For now, simply note down your base HP.
Your Hit dice are a way to recover health between battles, specifically during a short rest. Every class starts with one dice at level 1 and the type is written in the class features section of the Player's Handbook.

**Magic** 
If you have chosen a magic user, you will likely see a very long list of spells and abilities. Not all of these may be available to you however. For example, a [[Wizard]] chooses an Arcane Tradition at level 2. Basically different disciplines of magic knowledge. This choice will change what spells become available as you level up. Be sure to read the description before diving into the spell list!
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Spell slots**
Continuing on, at the top of a magic user class, you will see a spell slot table. Casting magic is not free and it requires immense power and concentration. In game, this is signified with spell slots and spell power. If you wish to use a level 2 spell, you must expend a level 2 spell slot. See below the spell slots of a level 7 Wizard:

| Cantrips | Lv1 | Lv2 | Lv3 | Lv4 | Lv5 | Lv6 | Lv7 | Lv8 | Lv9 |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4        | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
In this case, the strongest spell this Wizard can cast is level 4, but only once. As they level up they will get more slots at higher levels.

> [!TIP]+ Once chosen, note down:
> - Hit points & Hit dice
> - Proficiency bonus
> - Saving throws & Skills
> - Equipment
> - Spells and Cantrips (if applicable)

> [!WARNING]+ Once again, Player’s Handbook only
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 3. Ability Scores
After choosing a race and class, it’s finally time to pick up some dice! Abilities are the big squares on the far left of your character sheet. These numbers will go on to inform every action (and every dice roll) you make with this character.
Grab 4d6 (four, six sided dice) or as many as you have. Roll all 4 dice and add up the three largest results. For example, if I rolled 5, 4, 1 and 1, I would remove a 1 and add up the rest, leaving 10. Do this 5 more times until you have six numbers.
You can choose how to assign those points however you like, just keep in mind that each class benefits from big numbers in one or more ability. A barbarian with low strength might be funny, but you’ll struggle in a fight.
If don’t like leaving your ability scores up to the fates, you can use the following instead:
- **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**

> [!WARNING] Don’t forget to add any modifiers from your race and/or class

> [!TIP] No dice? No problem! Follow this link to the [Google virtual dice roller](https://g.co/kgs/u7qNMtg)

**Modifiers**
Modifiers are what you add or subtract from any dice roll under an ability. For example, if you tried to backflip, you might roll 1d20 and use your dexterity modifier. The higher your base dexterity score, the more likely you succeed in the roll, and the backflip.
Once you have your ability scores written down, use the table below to figure out what your modifiers are and write them next to the relevant ability

| **Score** | Modifier | **Score** | Modifier |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| **1**     | -5       | **16-17** | +3       |
| **2-3**   | -4       | **18-19** | +4       |
| **4-5**   | -3       | **20-21** | +5       |
| **6-7**   | -2       | **22-23** | +6       |
| **8-9**   | -1       | **24-25** | +7       |
| **10-11** | +0       | **26-27** | +8       |
| **12-13** | +1       | **28-29** | +9       |
| **14-15** | +2       | **30**    | +10      |
> [!WARNING] Don't forget to add your constitution modifier to your base hit points

**Skills and Saving Throws**
To the right of your abilities are the skill and saving throws. When you, for example, try for that backflip again, the GM will ask for a dexterity OR an acrobatics roll. If your athletics modifier was larger, you might choose that one just to have a better chance at that sweet flip! 
Saving throws are essentially your ability to resist be it an attack or poison. For example, if you drank a little too much ale, you might be asked for a constitution saving throw to see if you can handle it.
Next to each item is a little circle and line. The circle denotes [[Proficiency Bonus|proficiency]] and the line if for the modifier. The modifiers come directly from the related ability so if you have +3 charisma, you have +3 intimidation, and so on.

# 4. The Character
Time to find out who you are, or rather, who you’ll be playing as. Where was your character born? Their favourite food? Who taught them to use a sword?
D&D is a role-playing game, and while you don’t have to put on a voice and act your heart out, a little bit of backstory can help give a bit of spice and gravitas to your adventure. 
Speak with your GM about your ideas. You may have grown up a street urchin under the foot of a rich city and its nobles. However if the adventure never goes to a similar city, you might never get to explore that facet of your character.

**Background**
Who was your character before joining the adventuring life? This is a way to flesh out your character for some of the role-playing aspects, but it can also contribute to gameplay. These take the form of four attributes:
1. Personality Traits
2. Ideals
3. Bonds
4. Flaws
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

There are many pre-made backgrounds that can help you to fill these in. Below is a list of the general gameplay benefits each one provides:

| Background    | Skill Prof                               | Tool Prof                             | Languages |

| Charlatan     | Deception (Cha)<br>Sleight of Hand (Dex) | Disguise kit<br>Forgery kit           |           |

| Outlander     | Atletics (Str)<br>Survival (Wis)         | 1 Musical instrument                  | Any 1     |
| Sage          | Arcana (Int)<br>History (Int)            |                                       | Any 2     |

| Urchin        | Sleight of Hand (Dex)<br>Stealth (Dex)   | Disguise kit<br>Thieves tools         |           |

On top of this, each background gains a feature. Something that might be helpful in pinch. For example, the Sailor has Ship's Passage allowing free naval travel where you need.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Alignment**
Alignments describes your character’s general morality. This doesn't have to be exactly who you are, but it can be helpful as a guide.

| x           | Lawful                                                                        | Neutral                                                               | Chaotic                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Good**    | Can be counted on to do the right <br>thing as expected by society.           | Does the best the can to help others<br>according to their needs.     | Acts as their conscience directs<br>with little regard for what others expect. |
| **Neutral** | Acts in accordance with the law<br>tradition, or personal codes.              | Doesn’t take sides, only doing<br>what seems best at the time.        | Follows their own whims, holding<br>personal freedom above all else.           |
| **Evil**    | Takes what they want within the<br>limits of traditions, loyalties or orders. | Does whatever they can get away with<br>without compassion or qualms. | Acts with arbitrary violence spurred<br>by a primal feeling within.            |

# 5. Equipment
Each class has a starter set of equipment with some optional ones too. as you go through, add these to your equipment section.


**Armour Class**
This is your defence stat. The higher it is, the harder you are to hit. By default, this will be 10 plus your dexterity modifier. After this you add any armour or shields you have equipped
