description: "You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways: \n-  You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location. \n-  You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube. \n-  You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour. \n-  You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location-to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour. \n\n If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action."
