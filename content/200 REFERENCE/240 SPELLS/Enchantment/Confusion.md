## Description:
This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or by affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behaviour for that turn.

| d10  | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2-6  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
| 7-8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.                                                                                                                                                         |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target

## At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each spell slot above 4th.
