description: "This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no longer than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\n\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object."
