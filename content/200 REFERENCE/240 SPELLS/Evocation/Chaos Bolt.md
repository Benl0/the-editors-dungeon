## Description:
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8  | Damage Type |
| :-: | ----------- |
|  1  | Acid        |
|  2  | Cold        |
|  3  | Fire        |
|  4  | Force       |
|  5  | Lightning   |
|  6  | Poison      |
|  7  | Psychic     |
|  8  | Thunder     |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

## At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
