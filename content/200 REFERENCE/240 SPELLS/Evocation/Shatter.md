A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a lO-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

## At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd levei or higher, the damage increases by ld8 for each slot level above 2nd.
