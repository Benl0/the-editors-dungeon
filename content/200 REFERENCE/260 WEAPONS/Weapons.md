# Beyond fisticuffs
Unless you're going for a brawler build, you will likely be using some sort of sword, bow, hammer or other such instrument to inflict pain. What you use, will be largely determined by the [[Proficiency Bonus|proficiency]] your [[Classes|class]] provides.

## Classification and Stats
Each weapon will have the following attributes:
- Price (in [[Currency|gold pieces]])
- Weight
- Damage (on successful hits)
- [[Weapon Properties|Properties]]
- The type of weapon
