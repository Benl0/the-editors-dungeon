Background:
War has been my life for as long as I care to remember. My family fought previous wars against the undead. I trained up as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armour, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. I was a former soldier serving as part of a local village militia in Logue Town, guarding my local community from the nightly attacks of the undead.

I was never a professional soldier, and was mostly likely doing mundane work when I wasn’t being called upon for night duty. Despite this, facing battles and potential injury for my home served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond my village, making it hard to ever truly be comfortable.
I’m haunted by memories of war. I can’t get the images of violence out of my mind. I’ve lost too many friends, and I’m slow to make new ones.

The only thing that I care about is getting the job done, not interested in anyone else’s life, basically a bit of a loner.

I’ll never forget the crushing defeat my village suffered. The monstrous undead enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear. I struggle to sleep at night, and got PTSD from when I lost my best friend during the war. Got so scared with what happened to the village, that I abandoned my militia group, trying to redeem myself for my cowardliness
