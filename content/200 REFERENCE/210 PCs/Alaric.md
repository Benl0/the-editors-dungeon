Ranger  Wood Elf

Age -  250

General upbringing

Alaric, an elf born in the heart of an ancient forest, grew up honing his combat and archery skills under the guidance of his parents and village elders. His keen senses and natural agility made him a formidable hunter, while his mastery of the bow was unmatched among his peers.
As he reached adulthood, Alaric felt a restless longing to explore the world beyond the forest. With the blessings of his family, he set out on a journey that would take him far from home, armed with the lessons of his youth and the skills forged in countless hours of training.
Throughout his travels, Alaric's prowess in combat and archery served him well, earning him a reputation as a skilled warrior and a protector of the innocent. He roamed far and wide, seeking out adventure and facing dangers untold, his heart forever bound to the thrill of the open road and the call of distant horizons.
After leaving his home

Alariac begins his travels around Northern Stepmaw. He encounters a small settlement struggling with Bandits and creatures. He ends up protecting them for coin but over time grows fond of the inhabitants and his temporary accommodation becomes permanent as he begins to help in exchange for shelter and food. He uses his skills from his training to grow the infrastructure and train them in combat and survival. He ages with the young warriors and forms bonds with them. As decades pass the young warriors grow into positions of power and the small settlement prospers, growing into a thriving village.
A crisis hits the village when a Orc raiders from the island north of Stepmaw perform a night raid, capturing the child of an elder. It was a surprise attack, the ranger was left heavily wounded in the attack. After meditation and healing the Ranger seeks to recover the taken prisoner and prepares a journey to the island. Reluctantly after persuasion, he decides to take a small party of warriors opposed to going alone. The party's numbers dwindle as they travel to the settlement, as the island proves treacherous and full of hazards and creatures.
They make it to the camp, and the ranger is able to free the captured prisoner, beginning his journey back to the settlement. On the way back, he is separated from his remaining group and is captured by a native tribe of wildmen. He spends time as their prisoner but slowly gains their trust by teaching the tribe hunting and building tricks. Ten years pass, and the tribe allows the Ranger to leave.
He returns to the desert village, where much has changed. In the years of his absence, leadership has changed hands. The reception is hostile, with a new found hostility to Elves. His rescue party and close friends are no longer around. The ranger is no longer welcome and is seen as a traitor. He is cast out for treason and told to never return.
He sets up a camp on a nearby mountain overlooking the town and builds a basic camp with the intention of seeking out his old acquaintances and finding out more about what has been going on in his absence.
He spends his time honing his skills in hunting and combat. Due to his new home atop a hill, he trains with his longbow daily, greatly improving his accuracy.
In the time of the campaign, he lives in a grand compound he has built with the intention of moving out to find his old comrades.
Bloody discord didn't let me post it all so had to split it up
