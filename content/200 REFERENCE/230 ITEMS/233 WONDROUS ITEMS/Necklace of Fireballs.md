- # Necklace of Fireballs

    - **Type:** Wondrous Items
    - **Rarity:** rare
    - **Cost:** 3000 gp
- **Property:** 



## Description 

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15). You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
