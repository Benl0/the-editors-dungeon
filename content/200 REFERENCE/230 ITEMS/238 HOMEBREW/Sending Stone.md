A river stone imbued with the sending spell. Each stone has a unique rune pattern on the back. Copying that rune on another stone will connect the two, allowing verbal communication between the two stones.
Each stone only has enough charge for 2.5 minutes. To recharge, it must be left submerged in river or sea water for a long or short rest. Stagnant water (e.g. ponds) will not recharge the stone.
