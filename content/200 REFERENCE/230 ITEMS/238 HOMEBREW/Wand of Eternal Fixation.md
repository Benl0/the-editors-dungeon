##### Back: [[Items]]

A wand charged with the [[Planar Anchor]] spell. Visually appears as the [[Flesh to Stone]] spell with a bright indigo light.
Creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the spell will fail. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and begins turning to stone. At the start of its turn, the creature must make another Charisma saving throw. On three successful saves, the spell is repelled.
After 1 minute, the creature is fully petrified and becomes a planar anchor.
