A warm, toasty robe. Once per hour, you can reach into the sleeve of this robe a pull out a fresh roll of bread. Roll a d100 to determine what type of bread.
The bread produced by this robe is perfectly normal bread and can be eaten for sustenance. Throwing the bread doesn't hurt, it is annoying though.
