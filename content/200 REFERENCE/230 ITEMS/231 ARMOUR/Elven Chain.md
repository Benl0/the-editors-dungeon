## Description 

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armour. You are considered proficient with this armour even if you lack proficiency with medium armour.

Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armour offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
