    - **Type:** Potions Oils
    - **Rarity:** rare
    - **Cost:** 270 gp
- **Property:** 



## Description 

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
