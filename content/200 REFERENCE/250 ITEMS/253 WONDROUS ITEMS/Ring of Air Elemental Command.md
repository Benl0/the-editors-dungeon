description: "This ring is linked to one of the four Elemental Planes. The GM chooses or randomly determines the linked plane.\n\nWhile wearing this ring, you have advantage on attack rolls against the elementals, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, you have access to properties based on the Elemental Plane.\n\nThe ring has 5 charges. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Spells cast from the ring have a save DC of 17.\n\nYou can expend 2 of the ring's charges to cast dominate monster on an air elemental. In addition, when you fall, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. You can also speak and understand Auran.\nIf you help slay an air elemental while attuned to the ring, you gain access to the following additional properties: <ul> <li>You have resistance to lightning damage.</li> <li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover.</li> <li>You can cast the following spells from the ring, expending the necessary number of charges: chain lightning (3 charges), gust of wind (2 charges), or wind wall (1 charge).</li></ul>"
