On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.\n<strong>Spells:</strong> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): hold monster (5 charges) or hold person (2 charges).\n<strong>Assisted Escape:</strong> While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple."
