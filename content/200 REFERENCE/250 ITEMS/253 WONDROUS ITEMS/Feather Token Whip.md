description: "This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.\n\nEffect of this token:\nYou can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a Bonus Action to make a melee spell Attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an Attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\nAs a Bonus Action on Your Turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the Attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die. "
