description: "While wearing this armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armour's command word and cause the armour to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armour. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armour retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armour."
